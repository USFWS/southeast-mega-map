The refuge was established in 1991 and was named after the late Dr. Archie Carr, Jr., in honor of his extraordinary contribution to sea turtle conservation. The refuge was designated to protect habitat for what is the most significant area for loggerhead sea turtle nesting in the Western Hemisphere, and the most significant area for green turtle nesting in North America. The long stretches of quiet, undisturbed sandy beaches, with little or no artificial light, are essential to the reproductive success and survival of the 15,000 to 20,000 sea turtles nesting annually."

In the late 1800's and early 1900's excessive drainage activities occurred in the Everglades to pave the way for agriculture and development to meet the ever-increasing water needs of agriculture and population expansion.  To the northwest of the refuge is the Everglades Agriculture Area which includes sugar cane farms, winter vegetables, sod farms, and cattle ranches. The land east of the refuge is predominately urban with the exception of the agricultural lands of the East Coast Buffer area. To the south and southwest of the refuge lie Water Conservation Areas 2 and 3, and Everglades National Park the only remaining portions of the Everglades fresh water marsh."

        "narrative": "Big Branch Marsh NWR is one of eight refuges managed as part of the Southeast Louisiana National Wildlife Refuges Complex. Prior to establishing the refuge, area wetlands were threatened by urban expansion from the city of New Orleans. The refuge is comprised of over 18,000 acres of offshore grass beds, marshes, hardwood hammocks and pine ridges. With a variety of habitat on the refuge, shorebirds, wading birds, neotropical songbird migrants and a host of year-round resident waterfowl can be found here.  Deer, rabbit, mink, otter, raccoon, muskrat, and nutria all make their home here, and the marshes provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for a number of fresh and saltwater species."

The refuge's 5,618 acres include maritime forest, salt marsh, freshwater marsh, and beach habitat. In 1975, three thousand acres of the refuge were designated as National Wilderness. This barrier island refuge is located off the coast of McIntosh County, Georgia, about 50 miles south of the port city of Savannah. Blackbeard Island is accessible only by boat, and transportation to the refuge is not provided by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Visitors may use their own boats to reach the refuge or arrangements can be made through local boat captains and charter services. A public boat ramp on Harris Neck NWR (Barbour River Landing) may be used as a launching site for trips to the island.<br><br>The refuge offers visitors a variety of wildlife-dependent recreational activities year-round. Wildlife observation, especially birdwatching, is excellent throughout the year. In winter months, concentrations of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds utilize the marshlands and beaches, while songbirds abound in the wooded areas in the spring and fall. The existing trails and roads provide hikers with scenic paths ideal for nature study. Saltwater creeks that pass through the refuge marshes are open to fishing the entire year. Presently, two archery hunts for deer are scheduled on the island in the fall and winter (click here for hunting information).",

Roosevelt visited the islands in June of 1915, and this is the only refuge Roosevelt ever visited. The name was changed to Breton NWR on October 4, 1938.<br><br>Historically, Breton NWR has been the site of a Lighthouse Station (destroyed by Hurricane Katrina), a quarantine station, a small fishing village and even an oil production facility.  Currently the only infrastructure remaining on Breton NWR is a remnant of the oil production facility on Breton Island. Many anglers and birdwatchers have visited the island to enjoy its bounty, and the beauty of Breton and its wildlife has even been captured in artworks by the noted Gulf Coast artist Walter Inglis Anderson, who visited the islands on solo trips from Mississippi."

        "narrative": "The Caloosahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, administered as a satellite refuge of J.N. \"Ding\" Darling NWR, is located in Lee County on the Caloosahatchee River within the city of Fort Myers. The refuge was established by President Woodrow Wilson on July 1, 1920, through Executive Order 3299 as a \"... preserve and breeding ground for native birds\". Originally, the Caloosahatchee refuge consisted of several mangrove islands. However, shoreline development, dredging of the river, and construction of the I-75 bridge has changed the physical arrangement and appearance of these islands. Today, the refuge still remains approximately 40 acres of mangrove shorelines and upland island habitats. The refuge is located adjacent to the Florida Power and Light Company's Orange River Power Plant and the Orange River's outflow. The warm water outflow from the power plant is a major wintering area for the endangered West Indian manatee."

Waterfowl are abundant during the winter. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 ducks have been recorded. In 1979, the Duck Lake Impoundment was created to provide 1200 acres of waterfowl habitat. Management of the impoundment is to manipulate water levels to promote the growth of aquatic and moist soil vegetation. In 2001, Catahoula NWR was designated a Globally Important Bird Area. Catahoula Lake is recognized as a Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR site): a historic concentration area for shorebirds, waterbirds, and migrating/wintering waterfowl. Catahoula NWR also borders a portion of the Dewey Wills Wildlife Management Area. Together, these areas provide a haven for wildlife and preserve representative samples of the unique habitats originally found in the Lower Mississippi River Ecosystem."

The 4,218 acre refuge encompasses approximately 1,802 acres of lakes, sloughs, and creeks, 2,265 acres of bottomland hardwoods, and 151 acres of croplands and moist soil units.<br><br>The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide wood duck brood habitat and serve as a protected wintering area for waterfowl. Up to 200 broods of wood ducks are produced anually in the refuge's artificial nest boxes, and wintering waterfowl numbers can exceed 10,000. In addition, numerous neotropical migrant and wading birds benefit from management activities. Following a successful bald eagle hacking program in the early 1990's the refuge has played host to a nesting pair of eagles each winter. During the summer months wood storks can be found resting and feeding in the back-water sloughs and moist soil units. Resident wildlife includes white-tailed deer, gray squirrels, turkey, raccoons, opossum, American alligator, and beaver."

It is the only National Wildlife Refuge in the state of Kentucky and is comprised of one of the largest remaining bottomland hardwood forests in the region.<br><br>Bottomland hardwood forests are one of the most biologically productive ecosystems on land, and the rich moist soils from seasonal flooding nourish an explosion of wildlife diversity. Freshwater mussels, amphibians, fish, and mammals are all found in abundance here, and migratory songbirds and waterfowl take advantage of this rich habitat on their long flights from nesting to wintering grounds. This diversity and abundance of wildlife provides ample hunting, fishing, and other recreational opportunities. Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge protects, manages, and enhances this ecosystem and healthy and viable populations of wildlife found here through habitat and wildlife management, environmental education, and cooperative partnerships with conservation agencies and landowners."

These ponds are intensively managed for migrating waterfowl, shorebirds, and wading birds.  A majority of the refuge has been reforested in native bottomland hardwood species.  Almost all of this forested land is flooded annually during the winter and spring by backwater flooding.<br><br>Up to 10,000 migratory waterfowl winter on the refuge, and 34 species of shorebirds have been recorded during the spring and fall migration.  Peregrine falcons, least terns, black terns, bald and golden eagles, and wood storks have  been observed.  Due to intensive management, the refuge is critically important as a sanctuary for waterfowl and neotropical migratory birds.  For this  reason, the refuge is closed to public access except for an observation tower at the north end of the ponds."

D'Arbonne is one of five refuges managed in the North Louisiana Refuges Complex.<br><br>In years of normal or above rainfall, the refuge's bottomland hardwood forest is a very important overflow area for the Ouachita River basin. High water levels, which usually occur between January and May, can flood up to 87% of the refuge. The wetland forests not only provide habitat to wetland dependent wildlife, but they also reduce damage from flooding in developed areas, they filter silt and other particles from the water, they help neutralize pollutants in the water, and they provide recharge areas for aquifers (natural underground water storage areas)."

This island refuge was once the site of the former United States Army Fort Dade Military Reservation, and abundant reminders of this unique military past can be found scattered throughout the island today. Silent gun batteries testify to a time when mighty battleships reigned supreme on the world's oceans, and a brick carriage road meanders across the island recalling the days when mules and horses carried military personnel and their dependents on sunny picnics to the beaches. Today, gulls, least terns and other birds perch on the now silent batteries, while Gopher Tortoises, box turtles and an occasional tourist traverse the old carriage roads. Egmont key, an island that once quaked under the sound of massive coastal cannon fire, now resides quietly amid the sounds of wildlife as, once more, nature has taken over this little slice of Florida paradise."

The entire basin encompasses more than 350,000 acres, of which the Refuge comprises just less than 12,000 acres.<br><br>Part of the historical values of the ACE Basin were also protected. The refuge office, a former rice plantation house built in 1828, is one of only three antebellum mansions that survived the civil war in the ACE Basin area. Former owners ensured it would be preserved by placing it on the National Register of Historical Places. Undeveloped and unpolluted, the habitat remains diverse and extremely productive."

The refuge is located in the core of occupied panther territory, and protection of this important area was needed to ensure that not only panthers and their habitat were protected, but also important wildlife corridors that connected adjacent private and public lands.  In 1996, the refuge was expanded to 26,400 acres with the addition of more Collier family land through the Arizona-Florida Land Exchange Act of 1988.  Today, in addition to the 5-11 Florida panthers that den, hunt and roam the refuge each month, numerous other wildlife also call the refuge home, including black bears, bobcats, white-tailed deer, Big Cypress fox squirrels, alligators and wood storks."

The Refuge was named for the legendary African-American hunting guide who led President Theodore Roosevelt on his famous Mississippi bear hunting trip. When President Theodore Roosevelt, a passionate sportsman, traveled to Mississippi for a private bear hunt in 1902, Collier was tasked with planning almost every aspect of the adventure, including tracking and driving a bear to the President’s hunting blind to offer him a clear shot. However, the timing didn’t work out as planned, and President Roosevelt left the blind for lunch at the camp before Collier’s team could bring the bear into position. To protect his hunting team, Collier restrained the bear and tied it to a tree. When President Roosevelt arrived, he, like any hunter of honor, would not shoot the restrained animal. The event was publicized nationwide and resulted in the creation of the first stuffed toy bear called “Teddy’s bear.” President Roosevelt told Collier during the trip that he, &ldquo;…was the best guide and hunter he’d ever seen.&rdquo;",

President Theodore Roosevelt created the refuge in 1908 as a preserve and breeding ground for colonial nesting birds and other wildlife, during the period when widespread plume hunting was devastating bird populations throughout Florida. Key West NWR is west of Key West, Florida, and accessible only by boat. Key West NWR consists of the Marquesas Keys and 13 other keys distributed across over 375 square miles of open water.  The refuge encompasses 208,308 acres of land and water, with only 1 percent (2,019 acres) being land. Most islands are dominated by mangrove plant communities. Exceptions are the hardwood hammock in the Marquesas Keys and the beaches and dunes there and on Boca Grande and Woman Keys. All islands lack freshwater and native, terrestrial mammals are absent.<br><br>Key West NWR provides habitat and protection for federally listed species, including piping plover and roseate terns. The refuge harbors the largest wintering population of piping plovers and the largest colony of white-crowned pigeons in the Florida Keys. It is a haven for over 250 species of birds, including 10 wading bird species that nest in the refuge. Other notable imperiled species include the Miami blue butterfly and sea turtles. Waters within the refuge’s administrative boundaries are important developmental habitat for green, loggerhead, and hawksbill turtles. More loggerhead and green sea turtle nests are found each year in Key West NWR than any area of the Florida Keys except for the Dry Tortugas."

        "narrative": "Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge is located at 209 Nature Road, at the end of Highway 3056, eleven miles southwest of Lake Arthur, Louisiana off Hwy. 14. The office is open year round, weekdays only, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., excluding federal holidays. Portions of the refuge are open year round from one hour before sunrise until one hour after sunset. Please consult refuge brochures or contact the refuge office for more details. Vicinity and refuge maps are available.<br><br>Refuge staff are responsible for managing the nearly 35,000 acre refuge, most of which is freshwater marsh habitat. The refuge preserves a major wintering site for waterfowl in the United States. Historical wintering duck populations and geese at Lacassine are among the largest in the National Wildlife Refuge System. The sanctuary provided at Lacassine Pool is critical to the long-term viability of continental pintail populations and is one of the key pintail wintering areas in the continent, with a wintering pintail population that has reached almost 400,000 - which is 50% to 80% of the entire southwest Louisiana midwinter survey."

John Mackie purchased it around 1768 and over the years the name was somehow changed to Mackay Island. Other previous owners include Thomas Dixon, author of &ldquo;The Klansmen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Birth of a Nation&rdquo; and Joseph P. Knapp, founder of &ldquo;More Game Birds In America&rdquo; which is now known as &ldquo;Ducks Unlimited&rdquo;. He built a private resort and experimented with various wildlife management techniques, some of which are still used today. After Knapps' death, Mackay Island passed through several owners until the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service recognized the value of the area as a refuge and acquired it in 1961."

        "narrative": "Established in 1903, the Mammoth Spring National Fish Hatchery is located in Mammoth Spring, Arkansas, just across from the Missouri border about 65 miles northwest of Jonesboro, Arkansas. The hatchery is one of the oldest in the United States, and was built in the Ozark foothills in northeast Arkansas due to the availability of cool gravity flow water from the world’s tenth largest spring and easy access to the railroad. Current programs involve the restoration of interjurisdictional fishes (paddlefish and sturgeon); recovery of endangered and threatened species including freshwater mussels; restoration of Gulf Coast Striped Bass populations; restoration of walleye, smallmouth bass and rainbow trout in the White River drainage; and fishery management and stocking recreational fish on national wildlife refuges."

Today, through the efforts of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the 35,000 acre wildlife refuge once again hosts loblolly pines on the ridges with hardwoods found along creek bottoms and in scattered upland coves. Clear streams and beaver ponds provide ideal wetlands for migrating waterfowl. Wildlife populations have been restored, and Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge now serves as a model forest ecosystem for the management of wildlife.",

Waterfowl are most abundant from November through February, while alligators and other reptiles are frequently seen from March through October. Birdwatching opportunities are good all year, but are best from October through April when temperatures are mild and many species of waterfowl and other wintering birds are present. Access to many areas is by boat only.",

Roosevelt, the refuge is an important resting and feeding area for migratory birds including gulls, terns, neotropical migratory songbirds, and shorebirds. During all seasons, the refuge's shoreline and open spoil deposits are used as resting sites for brown pelicans, gulls, and terns. Endangered species, including piping plovers and wood storks, have been observed on the refuge land, while shortnose sturgeon and manatees have been found in the waters bordering Tybee. The refuge is unstaffed and is administered from the Savannah Coastal Refuges complex headquarters office in Savannah, Georgia. The entire refuge is considered a sanctuary for migratory birds and is closed to all public use.",
